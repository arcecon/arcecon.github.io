Mason)\nPresented at the\n\nHeartland Environmental and Resource Economics Workshop at Illinois (2024)\n25th Annual CU Environmental and Resource Economics Workshop (2024)\nInternational Conference on Finance for the Common Good (2024)\nWestern Economic Association International Conference (2024)\n13th Annual Front Range Energy and Environmental Economics Camp (2024)\nSymposium on Assessing Policy Strategies for Scaling Carbon Capture and Storage in the United States (2024)\nColorado State University/University of Wyoming Seminar (2024)\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: We examine the optimal timing of a firm’s decision to invest in a CCUS facility using an investment under uncertainty framework. The uncertainties we include that affect the firm’s investment decision are profits (via a geometric Brownian motion [GBM]) and policies (via a Poisson arrival process). We find both an increase in the value and variation of the investment when both uncertainties are included, and the increase in variation causes the firm to wait longer to invest in the CCUS facility than if neither uncertainty or if only one uncertainty is included.\n\n\n\n\n\nImpacts of state-level policies on wind farm investments\nAbstract: I examine how taxes and tax exemptions across states affect wind farm investments by using two methods. I first use a synthetic control method to examine the impacts of the Texas Chapters 312 and 313 tax codes on wind farm investments. I then conduct a staggered difference-in-differences (DiD) method, where I quantify the effects of both state-level tax incentives and taxes on wind farm investments.\n\n\n\n\n Works in Progress\n\nFirm’s optimal decision to invest in a wind farm using an investment under uncertainty framework\nPresented at the\n\nMidwest Economics Association Conference (2025)\nEastern Economic Association Conference (2025)\nSouthern Economic Association Conference (2023)\n2nd Year Paper Symposium (2022)\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: I examine the optimal timing of a firm’s investment decision in a wind farm using an investment under uncertainty framework. I examine three sources of uncertainty that affect the firm’s investment decision - weather patterns, electricity prices, and policies. The results show that greater uncertainty in weather patterns, electricity prices, and policies increase the time the firm waits to invest in the wind farm.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of managing a common pool resource (with Jason F. Shogren, Irene Zapata-Morán, Nida Zafar, and Srutakirti Mukherjee)\nAbstract: We conduct a choice experiment to elicit people’s preferences for institutions that manage a common pool resource. Our results will help policymakers choose an institution that has the most public support for managing a common pool resource.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Experience\n\nResearch Assistant for Professor Charles F. Mason, University of Wyoming (2021 – Present)\n\nAssociate Editor for the journal Economics of Energy and Environmental Policy.\n\nFinding and inviting referees for submitted articles, and reviewing submitted articles.\n\nConducting research for a grant through the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to assess policy strategies for scaling carbon capture and storage in the United States.\nConstructing a theoretical model on the investment decision in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), and solving the model via numerical simulation.\nConducting a literature review on real options approaches for CCUS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntern - Student Trainee Economist, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (2023)\n\nCreating an interactive map that shows company-level receipt and delivery points at physical natural gas hubs along a pipeline.\nConstructing a dashboard that shows number of physical and financial transactions on each natural gas hub for a selected company and period."
